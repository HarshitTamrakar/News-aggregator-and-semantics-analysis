# News Sentiment Analysis Project
This project fetches news articles from an external source based on user-provided query parameters and performs sentiment analysis using the Chat GPT language model. The aim of the project is to analyze the sentiment of news articles and provide insights into the overall sentiment of the content.

# Features
The project offers the following features:

1. News Fetching: Users can provide a query parameter to specify the topic or keyword for which they want to fetch news articles. The project utilizes an external API to fetch the latest news related to the provided query.

2. Sentiment Analysis: The fetched news articles are then passed to the Chat GPT language model for sentiment analysis. The language model analyzes the text and determines the sentiment of each article as positive, negative, or neutral.
